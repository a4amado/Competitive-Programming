# My Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my personal competitive programming repository! I'm Adel (a4addel), and this is where I document my progress and solutions as I tackle various coding challenges.

## About Me

I'm passionate about problem-solving and constantly improving my coding skills. This repository serves as both a personal archive and a testament to my growth in the world of competitive programming.

## What's Inside

This repository contains my solutions to problems from various platforms:

- LeetCode
- CodeForces
- Online Judge
- CPU Standard challenges

You'll find solutions in C++ and Python, my preferred languages for competitive programming.

## Repository Highlights

- `LeetCode/`: My latest conquest includes solving the "Clone Graph" problem (#133)
- `DS/Binary-Tree/`: Exploring the intricacies of binary trees
- `Code Forces/`: Sharpening my skills with diverse challenges
- `Online Judge/001. Level A/`: Taking on fundamental problems to solidify my base

## My Progress

I'm consistently pushing myself to solve more complex problems. Recent achievements include:

- Solved multiple problems (September 2, 2024)
- Cracked a medium difficulty graph problem (March 28, 2024)
- Implemented the "Clone Graph" algorithm (March 11, 2024)

## Why This Repository?

1. **Track Progress**: It's amazing to look back and see how far I've come.
2. **Share Knowledge**: While these are my solutions, I hope they can help or inspire others.
3. **Continuous Learning**: Each problem teaches me something new about algorithms, data structures, or even a language quirk.

## Connect With Me

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss a solution, suggest a problem, or just chat about competitive programming!

## Note to Visitors

While I appreciate you checking out my solutions, I encourage you to attempt the problems yourself first. The joy is in the solving!

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
